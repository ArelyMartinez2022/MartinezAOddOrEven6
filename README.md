THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER FOR A NUMBER 
ONCE THEY ENTER A VAILD WHOLE NUMEBR THE
PROGRAM WILL DETERMINE IF ITS ODD OR EVEN. IF
ITS NOT A VAILD INPUT IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASK 
THEY USER UNTILL IT VAILD. AT THE END THE PROGRAM 
WILL ASK THE USER TO PLAY AGAIN. IF THEY ENTER "YES"
THE PROGRAM WILL REPLAY. IF THEY ENTER "NO" IT WILL 
END IF THEY ENTER ANY VARIATION THAT ISNT YES OR NO 
THEN IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASK THEM UNTIL THEY DO. 

PEER REVIEW: JESSIE LAMZON
CODE IS SUCCESSFUL AND PROVIDES VALIDATION WHEN ENTERING TOO MANY NUMBERS
OR WRONG CHARACTERS.  VALIDATION ALSO WORKS PLAY AGAIN.
